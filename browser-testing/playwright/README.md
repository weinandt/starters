# Playwright Tests

Executes a test suite against multiple browser versions.

## To Run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run install-playwright-browsers`
3. `npm run test`
4. `npm run show-test-report`



## TODO:
1. Do you need a playwright config?
2. How to you watch tests interactively?
3. How do you run in a container?
4. How do you wait for dynamic content to load (like if react has to render something)?
5. How do you follow redirects and assert cookies were set.
