## TODO:
- Request validation
- Response validation
- SDK generation
    - Typescript
    - Golang
- Api server mocks which can be imported in other service's tests
- How to handle 301 redirects (so auth servers can re-direct)
- How to use for security testing
- How to set up auth for docs, so users can test api in the browser
- Determine if you need express-swagger-ui or if you can just distribute the open api spec and some html.
